## Assignment 4

#### Person
We chose an abstract class `Person` which `Employee`, `Customer` and the different Technicians extend.
Its only task is to create an ID and store the name as well as surname.

#### Level
We represent the indivuals levels with an enum.

#### Employee
TODO

#### Customer
TODO

#### Technicians
We created an interface which Backend as well as Frontend technicians implement. 
Since there is extremely limited functionality in these two classes,
it is there to be used in the future.
